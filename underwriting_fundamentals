NDERWRITING FUNDAMENTALS FOR YOUR APP

1. What is Underwriting in Insurance/Reinsurance?
Underwriting is the process of evaluating risk and determining the terms (premium, coverage, exclusions) for offering insurance.

In reinsurance, underwriting happens at a larger, aggregated risk level, sometimes involving groups of policies, portfolios, or high-value risks.

An underwriter analyzes the information submitted and decides:

- Approve, and at what cost (premium)
- Reject, if the risk is too high
- Modify coverage (e.g., impose special terms)

2. Steps of Underwriting (Simplified for App)

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1.   | Risk Data Collection: Collect all client/risk details (via "submission" form). |
| 2.   | Risk Assessment: Analyze the risk level of the client (using models/scoring logic). |
| 3.   | Premium Calculation: Based on the risk score and coverage amount. |
| 4.   | Offer Quote: Create and send a quote with terms and premium. |
| 5.   | Bind Policy (if accepted): Issue a formal policy document. |

3. Underwriting â€” Math, Models, and Algorithms
Here are some realistic, simple algorithms you can implement in your backend.

A. Risk Scoring Logic
We define a risk score for every submission. Higher score means more risk and a higher premium.

Example fields that could affect the risk score:

| Field                | How it affects risk?                  | Example scoring                  |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Industry type        | Some industries are riskier           | +20% if "Construction"           |
| Location             | Some areas are more disaster-prone    | +15% if "Flood zone"             |
| Annual Revenue       | Very high revenues could imply bigger claims | +10% if revenue > 10M          |
| Previous Claims      | History of claims increases risk      | +30% if >2 past claims           |
| Requested Coverage Amount | Large coverages need more scrutiny | +0.5% per 100K coverage         |

Sample simple Risk Scoring Algorithm:

    baseScore = 50  // neutral risk

    if industry == "Construction" or "Mining":
        baseScore += 20

    if located_in_flood_zone:
        baseScore += 15

    if revenue > 10_000_000:
        baseScore += 10

    if past_claims_count > 2:
        baseScore += 30

    finalRiskScore = baseScore
    Result: You now have a number like 75 (on a scale of 0-100).

B. Premium Calculation Formula Once we have the risk score, we can calculate the premium.

Simple premium formula:

    basePremium = coverage_amount * 0.01  // 1% of requested coverage

    risk_factor = riskScore / 100  // Normalize to [0, 1]

    finalPremium = basePremium * (1 + risk_factor)

Example:

Coverage requested: 1 Million
Risk Score: 75
Base premium: 1M * 0.01 = 10,000
Risk factor: 75/100 = 0.75
Final premium: 10,000 * (1 + 0.75) = 17,500

Final Quote: Premium = $17,500
